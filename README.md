Coffee Tracker App
Introduction
Welcome to the Coffee Tracker App! This application allows users to record their coffee consumption (or any other habit you wish to track). Built with Angular and .NET, this project demonstrates the power of combining these technologies to create a responsive and efficient full-stack web application.

The app consists of:

A C# Web API backend, which provides data services.  

An Angular frontend, which allows users to interact with and visualize their data.

Features
Record Tracking: Add, view, and filter your coffee (or other habit) consumption data. 

Date Filtering: Select specific dates to view records within a defined range. 

Backend API Integration: The Angular frontend communicates with the .NET Web API to store and retrieve data.
